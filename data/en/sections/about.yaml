# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a 3rd year software engineering student, although I have had a passion for robotics and programming since middle school! For example, in high school I coded [autonomous programs](https://github.com/thesixtium/FTC_Stuff/tree/main/FTC%202019-2020%20Skystone%20Competitive%20Codes) for competitive robotics, including implementing [custom computer vision algorithms](https://github.com/thesixtium/FTC_Stuff/blob/main/FTC%202019-2020%20Skystone%20Other%20Codes/VisionCodeCopyAndPaste.java). Outside of software, I work on PCB development, some fun projects such as building a can cannon, and enjoy training in martial arts.'
